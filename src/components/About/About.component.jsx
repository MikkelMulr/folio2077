						I come from a background in art, which has given me a deep appreciation for good design and knowing when
						things work and simply don't, then iterating until it locks in; a straight forward approach based on years
						of experience.

						Choosing to leave commercially working as an illustrator, was a decision I made because I wanted to be
						involved in something bigger and challenging in new ways. Programming was something I've tinkered with for
						many years, diving into webdev just became the thing that made sense, so here we are.

						These are some of my go-to tools when I jump into most projects. Though this list will change as I get
						hands-on with more fun stuff.
